/// a bit more flexible. To obtain an `&Arc<T>` you must have
/// an `Arc<T>` instance somewhere pinned down until we're done with it.
/// It's also a direct pointer to `T`, so using this involves less pointer-chasing
///
/// However, C++ code may hand us refcounted things as pointers to T directly,
/// so we have to conjure up a temporary `Arc` on the stack each time. The
/// same happens for when the object is managed by a `OffsetArc`.

/// without needing to worry about where the `Arc<T>` is.
